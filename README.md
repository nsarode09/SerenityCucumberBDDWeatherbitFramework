# SerenityCucumberBDDWeatherbitFramework

**Project Description: **
* The project helps to test **Weatherbit's API** with the **selenium serenity rest-assured** library.
* Serenity Cucumber BDD framework is used as it has libraries that make writing high-quality automated acceptance tests easy, with robust reporting and living  documentation features.
* The Project is a one-stop as it strongly supports web testing with Selenium and API testing using RestAssured.

**Technology Used:**
* Programming Language: Java 8
* Framework: Cucumber Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
* Build Management Tool: Maven 
* API library - Senerity Rest Assured (version - 3.9.0)
* Reporting: Serenity

**The project directory structure:**

The project is a maven project and follows the standard directory structure:

**pom.xml:**

It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.

All serenity, junits and json dependencies are present in this file, along with serenity-maven-plugin used to generate serenity report.

**The Sample Scenario:**

The scenarios are written in Gherkin language (Given, When, Then, And), which is a plain english language and thus helps non-programmers to understand the scenario.

**The Glue or Step Definition:**

This class helps to convert the cucumber english language text to test scripts. The Cucumber annotations line @Given, @And etc helps the compiler understand the prefined text and execute the command accordingly.

@Steps annotation indicates the step class

**The Step class:**

This class contains all the implementation methods

The @Steps annotation tells Serenity to create a new instance of the class, and inject any other steps or page objects that this instance might need.

**Actions Class:**

The project contains two action classes BaseActions and Utilities.
The BaseAction class contain all standard functions like initializing the driver if required for web automation.

The Utilities class contain generic project functions like reading config and reading CSV file.

**Executing the Test with Test Runner class:**

This class uses the Junit annotation @RunWith() and @CucumberOptions(), which tells JUnit what the test runner class is. It is more like a starting point for Junit to start executing the tests.

@RunWith annotation tells JUnit that tests should run using CucumberWithSerenity class present in 'Cucumber.api.junit' package.
@CucumberOptions annotation tells Cucumber a lot of things like where to look for feature files, where glue is present, run with tag and what reporting system to use.

**Generating the reports:**

Serenity reports gives aggregate information about all of the tests. It documents how features are tested, and what the api does.
The Full Serenity reports are generated by the serenity-maven-plugin which is added in pom.xml.

The report is customized by the properties added in serenity.properties file
